# Exagear-Frost
Exagear@Frost is a project that are based on Exagear Hugo 5in1 (since the modder rarely update the Exagear)

So I want to make it to looks more interesting with more apps and functions
# Does it support Xegw (Termux-X11 or DXVK)?
Yes, we have a Xegw cache that are supported DXVK
# Does it have VirGL Built-in?
No, because I don't know how to add it but I will try to add it
# What are the system requirements for this Exagear?
Turnip - Adreno 6xx and 7xx are compatible with Xegw cache.

VirGL - Almost all chipset are compatible

LLVM - Also all chipset are compatible but it's very slow

VirtIO-GPU - Some of Adreno GPU are working but it's performance are worse than VirGL
