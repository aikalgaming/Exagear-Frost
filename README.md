# Exagear-Frost
Exagear@Frost is a project that are based on Exagear Hugo 5in1 (since the modder rarely update the Exagear)
So I want to make it to looks more interesting with more apps and functions
# Does it support Xegw (Termux-X11 or DXVK)?
No. It's don't support Xegw because I don't know how to add it. I can add it if the new Exagear version from Hugo is released
# What are the system requirements for this Exagear?
Turnip - Adreno 618+ are compatible. Not compatible for Adreno 7xx due to new turnip build are only for Exagear with Xegw
VirGL - Almost all chipset are compatible
LLVM - Also all chipset are compatible but it's very slow
VirtIO-GPU - Some of Adreno GPU are working but it's performance are worse than VirGL
